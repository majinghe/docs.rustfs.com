# RustFS Introduction

RustFS is `high-performance`, `distributed` object storage software developed using the currently most popular and memory-safe Rust language worldwide. RustFS also has the characteristics of simplicity and efficiency, and is also an efficient, open-source, free object storage solution that can be deployed in local private clouds. RustFS is 100% compatible with the S3 protocol and is open-source software released under the Apache2 license. RustFS is written in the Rust language, currently the most popular and memory-safe language in the world. It is a commercial-friendly distributed object storage product developed and contributed by excellent engineers from around the world. RustFS can replace many object storage products with unfriendly open-source licenses.

RustFS will soon transition from commercial applications to open source and be released globally, helping the world reduce storage costs and improve data security.
