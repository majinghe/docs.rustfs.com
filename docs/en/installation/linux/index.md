# 1. What is RustFS?

RustFS is a simple, efficient, distributed object storage system, suitable for fast replacement of MinIO and object storage scenarios for AI training and inference.
At the same time, RustFS is an efficient, open-source, free object storage solution. It is 100% S3 protocol compatible and open-source software released under Apache2 license. RustFS is written in Rust, currently the world's most popular memory-safe language, particularly suitable for high-performance scenarios. RustFS is a commercial-friendly distributed object storage product developed and contributed to by excellent engineers worldwide. RustFS can replace many object storage products with unfriendly open-source licenses.

RustFS is about to transition from commercial applications to formal open-source release globally, helping the world reduce storage costs and improve data security.

## 2. Pre-Installation Reading

RustFS has three installation modes: single-node single-disk suitable mode, single-node multi-disk, and multi-node multi-disk modes. Among these, the multi-node multi-disk mode includes enterprise-grade available performance, security, and scalability. It also provides architecture diagrams needed for production workloads. Please read our startup modes and checklists before installation, as follows:

1. Please clarify your three installation startup modes:

    - [Single Node Single Disk Mode (SNSD)](./single-node-single-disk.md)
    - [Single Node Multiple Disk Mode (SNMD)](./single-node-multiple-disk.md)
    - [Multiple Node Multiple Disk Mode (MNMD)](./multiple-node-multiple-disk.md)

2. [Pre-installation checks](../checklists/index.md), ensure all indicators meet production guidance characteristics. If production standards are not needed, this guidance can be skipped.

## 3. Operating System and CPU Support

You can run RustFS on almost any CPU and operating system, whether Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD, Docker, or even edge gateways.
CPU architecture support: X86, ARM, and various other CPU architectures.
