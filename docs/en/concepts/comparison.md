## Global Object Storage Architecture Schools

Currently, distributed object storage products worldwide are mainly divided into two schools:

1. With metadata center, represented by: Ceph;

2. Without metadata center, represented by: RustFS and MinIO.

Comparison of advantages and disadvantages with/without metadata center:

| Feature | With Metadata Center | Without Metadata Center |
| - | - | - |
| Architecture Characteristics | Dedicated metadata server or center for unified metadata management | Metadata distributed across storage nodes, no dedicated metadata server |
| Metadata Management | Efficient centralized management, fast query and update | Distributed metadata storage, avoiding single-point bottlenecks |
| Single Point of Failure | Metadata server may become a single point of failure, requiring additional high-availability design | No single node failure risk |
| Deployment Complexity | Complex deployment and maintenance, requires professional operations skills | Relatively simple deployment and maintenance, suitable for cloud-native and containerized scenarios |
| Performance Issues | Under high concurrency, metadata server may become a performance bottleneck | Small file support will consume more IOPS |
| Typical Scenarios | File systems (such as Lustre, CephFS) and scenarios requiring complex metadata | Object storage (RustFS, MinIO) and large-scale distributed systems |


## About Storage Speed

RustFS and MinIO adopt the same design, with overall speed depending on the network and hard disk speed of storage nodes. After evaluation, RustFS can achieve 323 GB/s read speed and 183 GB/s write speed.

It can be said that RustFS and MinIO are the only two distributed object storage products in the world with leading speed. Under the same configuration, their speed far exceeds that of Ceph.
