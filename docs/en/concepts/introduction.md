# What is RustFS?

RustFS is a simple, efficient, and distributed object storage.
At the same time, it is also an efficient, open-source, and free object storage solution. It is 100% compatible with the S3 protocol and is open-source software released under the Apache2 license. RustFS is written in the currently most popular and memory-safe language, Rust.
It is a commercial-friendly distributed object storage product developed and contributed by excellent engineers from around the world. RustFS can replace many object storage products with unfriendly open-source licenses.

RustFS will soon transition from commercial applications to open source and be released globally, helping the world reduce storage costs and improve data security.

## Operating System and CPU Support

You can run RustFS on almost any CPU and operating system, whether it's Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD, Docker, or even edge gateways, you can run RustFS.
CPU architecture support: X86, ARM, and many other CPU architectures.
