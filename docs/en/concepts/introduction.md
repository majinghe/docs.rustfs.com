# What is RustFS?

RustFS is a simple, efficient, and distributed object storage solution.
It is also an efficient, open-source, and free object storage solution. It is 100% compatible with the S3 protocol and is open-source software released under the Apache2 license. RustFS is written in Rust, currently the world's most popular memory-safe programming language.
It is a commercially-friendly distributed object storage product participated in and contributed to by outstanding engineers from around the world. RustFS can replace many non-friendly open-source protocol object storage products.

RustFS is about to officially transition from commercial applications to open source, releasing globally to help the world reduce storage costs and improve data security.

## Operating System and CPU Support

You can run RustFS on almost any CPU and operating system, whether it's Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD, Docker, or even edge gateways.
CPU architecture support: X86, ARM, and various other CPU architectures.

## RustFS Features

- **S3 Compatible**: 100% compatible with S3 protocol, excellent compatibility with big data, data lakes, backup software, image processing software, and industrial production software;
- **Distributed**: RustFS is a distributed object storage, therefore, RustFS can meet various requirements;
