# Quantitative Trading File Storage Solution

Intelligent storage architecture designed specifically for high-frequency trading and quantitative strategy backtesting, supporting million-level IOPS order flow processing per second, meeting millisecond access requirements for Tick-level data

## Industry Challenges and Pain Points

| Category | Traditional Solution Defects | Quantitative Requirements | Business Impact |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Data Management** | Single protocol storage (S3 only/POSIX only) | Cross-protocol unified access (S3+POSIX+NFS) | Strategy iteration cycle ↑20% |
| **Performance Metrics** | ≤500k IOPS (small file random read) | 3M+ IOPS <0.5ms latency | High-frequency strategy slippage ↓0.3bps |
| **Storage Cost** | Cold data > $0.05/GB/month | Intelligent tiering ≤$0.015/GB/month | Annual storage budget growth ↓65% |

## Why Choose Us

### Ultra-Fast Response

- Adopts RDMA network acceleration and GPU direct storage, latency ≤500μs, throughput up to 200 Gbps
- High-frequency trading backtesting speed improved by 300%

### Massive File Support

- Intelligently aggregates small files into logical large objects, single cluster supports 400 billion files
- Metadata retrieval efficiency improved by 40%

### Elastic Scaling

- Supports hybrid cloud deployment, hot data local SSD acceleration, cold data automatic cloud archiving
- Capacity can linearly scale to EB level

### Financial Security

- Supports three-region five-center disaster recovery, RTO <1 minute

## Scenario-Based Solutions

### High-Frequency Strategy Development

Provides memory-mapped file interface (mmap), supporting C++/Python strategy code direct access to raw trading data

#### Measured Metrics

Single strategy backtesting of 1 billion order data takes only 4 hours (traditional solutions require 24+ hours)

### AI Factor Mining

Integrates TensorFlow/PyTorch plugins, automatically mapping feature datasets to S3 object storage paths

#### Case Study

Jufund achieved 3000+ factor parallel computing, storage throughput improved 8x

### Regulatory Compliance Storage

Built-in WORM (Write Once Read Many) mode, meeting non-tamperable trading record requirements

Automatically generates CFCA-compatible audit logs (processing 100k+ operation records per second)

## Industry Compliance and Security

### Financial-Grade Encryption **(Required)**

FIPS 140-2 certified national security dual algorithm support

### Cross-Regional Synchronization **(Required)**

Meets SEC 17a-4 off-site disaster recovery specifications

### Audit Interface **(Required)**

Direct integration with Splunk, Elastic regulatory modules

## Core Advantage Comparison

| Dimension | Traditional Solutions | rustFS Solutions | Business Value Manifestation |
|------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Order Flow Processing** | ≤500k IOPS | ✅ 2.3M IOPS | Eliminates order accumulation risk during market peaks |
| **Data Compression Ratio** | 3:1 | ✅ 11:1 (ZSTD+FPGA acceleration) | PB-level backtesting data storage cost reduced by 67% |
| **Failover Time** | 15–30 seconds | ✅ 82ms | Avoids SEC regulation penalties for system interruptions |
